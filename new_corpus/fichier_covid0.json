Methods: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset. Results: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251 to 1.431). These findings were consistent with the analysis based on the NHIS data using 704 final subjects. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.303 (95% CI, 0.135 to 0.682), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.391 to 1.682). Conclusion: This study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19.", "FAU": ["Rhee, Sang Youl", "Lee, Jeongwoo", "Nam, Hyewon", "Kyoung, Dae-Sung", "Shin, Dong Wook", "Kim, Dae Jung"], "AU": ["Rhee SY", "Lee J", "Nam H", "Kyoung DS", "Shin DW", "Kim DJ"], "AD": ["Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.", "Data Science Team, Hanmi Pharm.
