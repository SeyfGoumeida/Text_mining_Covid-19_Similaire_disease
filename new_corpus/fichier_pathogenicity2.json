Although many putative virulence factors (VFs) have been identified, the exact and wildly accepted virulence associated marker and pathogenesis mechanism of S. suis are still unclear. To establish connection of the genotypes with virulence phenotypes, we performed an \"internal standard\" method based on the zebrafish model to assess the virulence phenotypes of S. suis and did the genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on the genomes of 68 S. suis isolates. Through GWAS, a total number of 172 genes were identified. Among these genes, 143 of them distribute in virulent isolates. Further VFs interaction network analysis based on protein-protein interaction database found that 71 genes identified in this study could interact with known VFs and some of them even played an important role as the bridge between known VFs or formed important hub. In addition, 12 genes were found conserved in virulent isolates and 3 genes were conserved in avirulent isolates, 8 genes of the virulent conserved genes were belonging to a srtBCD pili cluster. Considering that sbp2', a member of the srtBCD pili cluster has been reported as a virulence-associated factor, we predict that sbp2' could be a fitness virulence-associated marker of virulent isolates. Taken together, our findings contribute to the insights in S. suis pathogenesis, enhance the knowledge of the genomic evolution of S. suis and provide several novel virulence-associated candidates.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
