We report the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam in Canada using a national registry. METHODS: The CLEAR registry uses REDCap(TM) (Research Electronic Data Capture) (online survey, https://is.gd/CLEAR_ceftolozanetazobactam) to capture details associated with clinical use of ceftolozane/tazobactam. RESULTS: Data from 51 patients treated in 2020 with ceftolozane/tazobactam are available. Infections treated included hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (37.3% of patients), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (15.7%), bone/joint infection (11.8%), complicated intra-abdominal infection (7.8%) and complicated skin and skin structure infection (7.8%). 17.6% of patients had bacteremia and 47.1% were in intensive care. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was primarily used as directed therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections (92.2% of patients). Ceftolozane/tazobactam was used because of resistance to (86.3%), failure of (11.7%), or adverse effects from (2.0%) previously prescribed antimicrobials. Ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility testing was performed on isolates from 88.2% of patients. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was used in combination with another antimicrobial active versus Gram-negative bacilli in 39.2% of patients (aminoglycosides [15.7%], fluoroquinolones [7.8%] and colistin/polymyxin B [7.8%]). The dosage regimen was customized in all patients based on their creatinine clearance. Treatment duration was primarily >10 days (60.8% of patients) with microbiological success in 60.5% and clinical success in 64.4% of patients. 7.8% of patients had adverse effects not requiring drug discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, ceftolozane/tazobactam is used as directed therapy to treat a variety of severe infections caused MDR P. aeruginosa. It is commonly used in combination with other antimicrobials with relatively high microbiological/clinical cure rates, and an excellent safety profile.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
