Sparse data exists regarding the association between the peak and duration of maternal fever and the extent and severity of maternal and neonatal complications. This study aims to examine the association between maternal intrapartum fever peak and duration, and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of term singleton live births in two medical centers between the years 2003 and 2015 was performed. The study group included parturients who experienced intrapartum fever, defined as >/=38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F). Fever duration was defined as the time elapsed between the first documented fever and subsequent first documented normal body temperature (<38 degrees C) (<100.4 degrees F), or if the temperature did not return to normal, until delivery. Adjusted risks for adverse perinatal outcomes were calculated by using multiple logistic regression models to control for confounders. RESULTS: A total cohort of 85,713 labors was analyzed, of which 1,517 (1.8%) parturients experienced fever during delivery. Adverse composite neonatal outcome rates increased gradually, in a dose-response manner, with higher maximal maternal temperature. Similar dose-response deterioration was found when maximal parturient temperature was combined with fever duration (p=0.015). Higher or longer maternal fever was not independently associated with cesarean or instrumental deliveries (p=0.648). Duration alone was not significantly associated with worsening neonatal outcomes (p=0.711). CONCLUSION: Maximal intrapartum maternal fever, solely and when combined with fever duration, correlates with neonatal complications in a dose-dependent manner. Further prospective studies are needed in order to examine the potential benefit of rigorous maternal body temperature control on perinatal outcome.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
