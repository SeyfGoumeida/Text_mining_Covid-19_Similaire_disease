Here, we investigated the genetic background of CE effectiveness by proteomic and genetic analysis in mice. Proteomic analysis in the two mouse lines showing a dramatic difference in CE effectiveness revealed a distinct polymorphism in the glia maturation factor beta gene. This polymorphism was significantly associated with the CE effectiveness in various prion-infected mouse lines. Sequencing of this gene and its vicinity genes also revealed several other polymorphisms that were significantly related to the CE effectiveness. These polymorphisms are useful as genetic markers for finding more suitable mouse lines and exploring the genetic factors of CE effectiveness.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.
