The vet practitioners were interviewed in order to analyze prescribing behavior and factors influencing antimicrobial prescription. Out of a total of 3928 antimicrobial prescriptions, 3673(93.5%) were recorded in dogs and 255 (6.5%) in cats during the study period in 7 veterinary clinics. The most prescribed antimicrobials were sulfamethoxypyridazine-trimethoprim (dog: 31.2%; cat: 28.6%), benzylpenicillin-streptomycin (dogs:19.0%; cat:21.9%) and marbofloxacin (dogs:18.3%; cats:16.1%). Almost, 64.6% of antimicrobial prescription in dogs was categorized as highly important antimicrobials and 34.9% as critically important antimicrobial agents. In cats, 77.9% of antimicrobial prescription was categorized as highly important antimicrobials and 22.1% as critically important antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobials were mostly used for gastro-intestinal disorders (31.9%) and skin diseases (24. 1%) in dogs while they were mostly applied for surgical problems (29.8%), musculo-skeletal disease (20.4%) and gastro-intestinal tract diseases (19.6%) in cats. Fluoroquinolones were administered as first option instead of third option. Antimicrobials were associated with other veterinary drugs (anti-inflammatory, internal and external parasite therapy) in 75.3% of cases. The prescription of antimicrobials was based on clinical diagnosis (symptom-based), ease of drug administration, owner's purchasing power and antibiogram. This study highlights the necessity to promote antimicrobial stewardship in pet medicine in Cameroon. Confirmatory diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing before antibiotic prescription should be encouraged. The uncontrolled use of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine and especially their indiscriminate use may favor the occurrence of AMR public health issues.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.
