A pilot clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy ofintravenous ozonised saline treatment in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 patients were administered 200 ml freshly prepared ozonised saline intravenously over 1 h once a day for 8 days along with standard medical treatment. Clinical symptoms were monitored everyday and laboratory biomarkers, radiological findings at 1,3,6,10 days. Telephonic follow up was done for all after discharge till Day 14. 7 out of 10 patients required oxygen supplementation at recruitment. RESULTS: There was severe adverse event recorded in the study group.All patients improved from moderate to mild category in average 8 days and were discharged in average 9.7 days. None deteriorated to severe stage. All clinical symptoms resolved within 6 days and oxygen supplementation requirement reduced to none within 4.1 days. There wasstatistically significant reduction inCRP (p = 0.003), D-Dimer (p = 0.049), IL6 (p = 0.002)and statistically significant improvement (p = 0.001) in SpO2/FiO2 ratio. Change in LDH was borderline statistically not significant (p = 0.058).All patients showed significant resolution of bilateral interstitial infiltrates at the end of 10 days. CONCLUSION: Resolved clinical symptoms, improved oxygenation, clearance of infiltrates on Chest X-ray and improvement in biomarkers in a short period with non-progression of the disease showed that IV ozonised saline therapy was safe and effective to prevent disease progression in COVID-19, making it an effective novel therapeutic tool.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
