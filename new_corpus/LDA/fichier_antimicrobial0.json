The functional fillers were evenly distributed in the polymer matrix and formed a film compatible with the chitosan/gelatin polymer matrix. However, the functional material did not affect the physical properties such as mechanical, thermal, and water vapor barrier properties of the film but exhibited high light transmittance with enhanced UV blocking properties. The rutin release from the composite film was evaluated using various food simulant solutions and found that rutin was released faster in acidic and alcoholic solutions. The chitosan/gelatin-based composite film showed potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. In addition, the combined use of CEO and rutin showed a synergistic effect of functional properties. The CEO and rutin-added chitosan/gelatin-based films with improved physical and functional properties can be used for active food packaging applications.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
