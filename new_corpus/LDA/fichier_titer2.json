To improve the production efficiency of R-(-)-linalool in Escherichia coli, three enzymes [E. coli-derived isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, Abies grandis-derived geranyl diphosphate synthase, and Streptomyces clavuligerus-derived (3R)-linalool synthases] were physically colocalized to synthetic complexes using synthetic protein scaffolds of GTPase-binding domain, Src homology 3, and PSD95/DlgA/Zo-1. R-(-)-Linalool was produced at the highest concentration in the strain IGL114 containing a scaffold ratio of 1:1:4. By further optimizing the inducer, temperature, and glycerol concentration, the production titer of R-(-)-linalool in the shake flask was increased by approximately 10 times compared with that of the scaffold-free control and was 2.78 times the previously reported yield. The production in the fermenter was about 1.5 times the previous highest production. In general, the final strain accumulated 277.8 and 1523.2 mg/L R-(-)-linalool under the conditions of shake-flask and fed-batch fermentation, respectively. This study provides a foundation for the assembly of bacterial intracellular protein scaffolds.", "FAU": ["Wu, Jing", "Wang, Xun", "Xiao, Longjie", "Wang, Fei", "Zhang, Yu", "Li, Xun"], "AU": ["Wu J", "Wang X", "Xiao L", "Wang F", "Zhang Y", "Li X"], "AD": ["Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Utilization of Agro-Forest Biomass, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biomass-Based Green Fuels and Chemicals, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.", "International Innovation Center for Forest Chemicals and Materials, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6428-5111", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2614-5975", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1267-9263"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Agric Food Chem", "JT": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "JID": "0374755", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Escherichia coli", "R-(-)-linalool", "linalool synthase", "metabolic engineering", "synthetic scaffold"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 12:13"], "PHST": ["2021/05/13 12:13 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01101 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Agric Food Chem. 2021 May 13. doi: 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01101."}
