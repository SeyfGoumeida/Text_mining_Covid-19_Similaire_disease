Of special concern are those children exposed prenatally to ZIKV and born without microcephaly or other congenital anomalies. Electrocardiogram (ECG) - derived heart rate variability (HRV) metrics represent an attractive, low-cost, widely deployable tool for early identification of developmental functional alterations in exposed children born without such overt clinical symptoms. We hypothesized that HRV in such children would yield a biomarker of fetal ZIKV exposure. Our objective was to test this hypothesis in young children exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. Approach We investigated the HRV properties of 21 children aged 4 to 25 months from Brazil. The infants were divided into two groups, the ZIKV-exposed (n=13) and controls (n=8). Single-channel ECG was recorded in each child at ~15 months of age and HRV was analyzed in 5 min segments to provide a comprehensive characterization of the degree of variability and complexity of the heart rate. Main results Using a cubic Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier we identified babies as Zika cases or controls with a negative predictive value of 92% and a positive predictive value of 86%. Our results show that a machine learning model derived from HRV metrics can help differentiate between ZIKV-affected, yet asymptomatic, and non-ZIKV exposed babies. We identified the Box Count as the best HRV metric in this study allowing such differentiation, regardless of the presence of microcephaly. Significance We show that it is feasible to measure HRV in infants and toddlers using a small non-invasive portable ECG device and that such an approach may uncover the memory of in utero exposure to ZIKV. We discuss putative mechanisms. This approach may be useful for future studies and low-cost screening tools involving this challenging to examine population.", "CI": ["(c) 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine."], "FAU": ["Herry, Christophe Louis", "Soares, Helena M F", "Schuler-Faccini, Lavinia", "Frasch, Martin G"], "AU": ["Herry CL", "Soares HMF", "Schuler-Faccini L", "Frasch MG"], "AD": ["Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa Hospital - General Campus, 501 Smyth Road - Box 708, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, CANADA.", "Departamento de Genetica, INAGEMP, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, BRAZIL.", "INAGEMP - Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Instituto de Biociencias, Porto Alegre, RS, BRAZIL.", "GYNOB, University of Washington School of Public Health, Seattle, Washington, UNITED STATES."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "England", "TA": "Physiol Meas", "JT": "Physiological measurement", "JID": "9306921", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["ECG", "HRV", "Infection", "Pediatrics", "Zika"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:30"], "PHST": ["2021/05/13 20:30 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1088/1361-6579/ac010e [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Physiol Meas. 2021 May 13. doi: 10.1088/1361-6579/ac010e."}
