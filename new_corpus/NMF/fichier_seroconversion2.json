Seroconversion is measured frequently around the world, but the milk conversion rate is unknown. RESEARCH AIMS: To determine (1) the prevalence and (2) the dynamics of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk amongst lactating mothers in the Netherlands. METHODS: In this large prospective cohort study, lactating mothers (N = 2312) were included between October 12, 2020 and February 24, 2021. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of IgA antibodies in human milk and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in serum against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS: A total of 691 (30.6%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human milk and/or serum. Of these participants, 524 (23.1%) had IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk, and 356 (15.7%) had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. A total of 199 (8.8%) participants had antibodies in both human milk and serum. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies in human milk remain present at least 10 months after a polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk was 23.1% in our cohort. This high prevalence of antibodies in human milk might lead to passive immunity in many breastfed infants and may serve as protection against COVID-19.", "FAU": ["Juncker, Hannah G", "Romijn, Michelle", "Loth, Veerle N", "Ruhe, Eliza J M", "Bakker, Sjors", "Kleinendorst, Saskia", "de Groot, Christianne J M", "Pajkrt, Dasja", "Korosi, Aniko", "van Goudoever, Johannes B", "van Gils, Marit J", "van Keulen, Britt J"], "AU": ["Juncker HG", "Romijn M", "Loth VN", "Ruhe EJM", "Bakker S", "Kleinendorst S", "de Groot CJM", "Pajkrt D", "Korosi A", "van Goudoever JB", "van Gils MJ", "van Keulen BJ"], "AD": ["3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "84709 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences - Center for Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "26066 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "84709 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences - Center for Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Prevention, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.", "3325631209 Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam Reproduction & Development Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3960-1703"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Hum Lact", "JT": "Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association", "JID": "8709498", "SB": "N", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "breastfeeding", "breastmilk", "coronavirus", "immunoglobulins", "lactation secretory IgA", "spike protein"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 08:39"], "PHST": ["2021/05/13 08:39 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1177/08903344211018185 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Hum Lact. 2021 May 13:8903344211018185. doi: 10.1177/08903344211018185."}
