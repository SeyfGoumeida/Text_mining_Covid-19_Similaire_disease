Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a counter-regulatory enzyme that converts angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1-7) form in the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies have been analyzed the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19. Indeed, ACE2/Ang (1-7) system protects the lung against acute respiratory distress syndrome by its anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant function. However, SARS-Cov-2 can use ACE2 for host cell entry. Expression of ACE2 can be altered by several factors, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which also could increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Besides, since androgens increase the expression of ACE-2, males are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Although reported statistics showed a significantly different infection risks of COVID-19 between adults and children, the reason behind the different responses is still unclear. This review proposes the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of SARS-COV-2 induced pneumonia. The previous meta-analysis regarding the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of pneumonia showed that polymorphism only affects the adult's illness severity and not the children. Two recent meta-analyses examined the effect of ACE polymorphism on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and reported contradicting results. Our opinion paper suggests that the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of COVID-19 depends on the patients age, same as of the pneumonia.", "CI": ["(c) 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."], "FAU": ["Mohaghegh, Sadra", "Motie, Parisa", "Motamedian, Saeed Reza"], "AU": ["Mohaghegh S", "Motie P", "Motamedian SR"], "AD": ["Dentofacial Deformities Research Center, Research Institute of Dental Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.", "Dentofacial Deformities Research Center, Research Institute of Dental Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.", "Dentofacial Deformities Research Center, Research Institute of Dental Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Clin Chem Lab Med", "JT": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "JID": "9806306", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "angiotensin-converting enzyme", "plasma proteins", "polymorphism"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:31"], "PHST": ["2020/11/30 00:00 [received]", "2021/05/03 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 20:31 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["cclm-2020-1877 [pii]", "10.1515/cclm-2020-1877 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Clin Chem Lab Med. 2021 May 13. pii: cclm-2020-1877. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2020-1877."}
