Yet, resistance against some deworming drugs and reinfection can still rapidly occur even after treatment. A vaccine against helminths would be an effective solution at preventing reinfection. However, vaccines against helminth parasites have yet to be successfully developed. While T helper cells and innate lymphoid cells have been established as important components of the protective type 2 response, the roles of B cells and antibodies remain the most controversial. Here, we review the roles of B cells during intestinal helminth infection. We discuss the potential factors that contribute to the context-specific roles for B cells in protection against diverse intestinal helminth parasite species, using evidence from well-defined murine model systems. Understanding the precise roles of B cells during resistance and susceptibility to helminth infection may offer a new perspective of type 2 protective immunity.", "FAU": ["Zaini, Aidil", "Good-Jacobson, Kim L", "Zaph, Colby"], "AU": ["Zaini A", "Good-Jacobson KL", "Zaph C"], "AD": ["Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.", "Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.", "Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1891-7274"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS Negl Trop Dis", "JT": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "JID": "101291488", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 17:23"], "PHST": ["2021/05/13 17:23 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pntd.0009340 [doi]", "PNTD-D-20-02206 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021 May 13;15(5):e0009340. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009340. eCollection 2021 May."}
