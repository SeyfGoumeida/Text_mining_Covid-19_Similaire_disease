In practice, however, there are also ADs written and signed by legal proxies (surrogates) on behalf of patients who lack decision-making capacity. Given their practical relevance and substantial ethical and legal implications, ADs by proxy (AD-Ps) have received surprisingly little scientific attention so far. OBJECTIVES: To study the form, content, validity, and applicability of AD-Ps among German nursing home residents and develop policy implications. METHODS: Secondary analysis of two independent cross-sectional studies in three German cities, comprising 21 nursing homes and 1528 residents. The identified AD-Ps were analyzed in parallel by three independent raters. Inter-rater agreement was measured using free-marginal multi-rater kappa statistics. RESULTS: Altogether, 46 AD-Ps were identified and pooled for analysis. On average (range), AD-Ps were 1 (1-7) year(s) old, 0.5 (0.25-4) pages long, signed by 1 (0-5) person, with evidence of legal proxy involvement in 35%, and signed by a physician in 20% of cases. Almost all the AD-Ps reviewed aimed to limit life-sustaining treatment (LST), but had widely varying content and ethical justifications, including references to earlier statements (30%) or actual behavior (11%). The most frequent explicit directives were: do-not-hospitalize (67%), do-not-tube-feed (37%), do-not-attempt-resuscitation (20%), and the general exclusion of any LST (28%). Inter-rater agreement was mostly moderate (kappa >/=0.6) or strong (kappa >/=0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Although AD-Ps are an empirical reality in German nursing homes, formal standards for such directives are lacking and their ethical justification based on substituted judgment or best interest standard often remains unclear. A qualified advance care planning process and corresponding documentation are required in order to safeguard the appropriate use of this important instrument and ensure adherence to ethico-legal standards.", "CI": ["(c) 2021 The Authors.
