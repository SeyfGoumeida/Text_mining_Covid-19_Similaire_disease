Currently, knowledge of biofilm formation by H. parasuis is not well developed. The objective of this study was to investigate the three-dimensional morphology of biofilms and perform transcriptomic analysis on H. parasuis cells in biofilm versus planktonic forms. The results showed that proteins and DNA accounted for a large proportion of the H. parasuis biofilm extracellular matrix. Here, we have traced the entire biofilm formation process of H. parasuis from beginning to end for the first time. These biofilms grew rapidly in the first 48 h and became stable at 60 h. According to GO and KEGG analysis, the differentially expressed genes (DEG) artM, artQ, ssrS, pflA and HutX were implicated as being involved in bacterial colonisation and adhesion; these are the most likely genes to affect biofilm formation. Most functional gene enrichments were of those involved in metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Thus, in the present pilot study, the composition and characteristics of these biofilms were explored, and the genes related to biofilm formation were screened for. This research lays the foundation for further studies on mechanisms regulating biofilm formation, in order to find new drug targets and develop new therapeutic drugs against H. parasuis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.
