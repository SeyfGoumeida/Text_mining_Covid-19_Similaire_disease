DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analyses based on epidemiological results from a specifically developed transmission model. SETTING: National vaccination programme in Sweden, over an 85- or 20-year time horizon depending on the vaccination strategy. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of people aged 12 months and 65-years at baseline. INTERVENTIONS: Four alternative vaccination strategies; 1, not to vaccinate; 2, varicella vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at age 12 months and a second dose at age 18 months; 3, herpes zoster vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at 65 years of age; and 4, both vaccine against varicella and herpes zoster with the before-mentioned strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accumulated cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for each strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: It would be cost-effective to vaccinate against varicella (dominant), but not to vaccinate against herpes zoster (ICER of EUR 200,000), assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of EUR 50,000 per QALY. The incremental analysis between varicella vaccination only and the combined programme results in a cost per gained QALY of almost EUR 1.6 million. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study are central components for policy-relevant decision-making, and suggest that it was cost-effective to introduce varicella vaccination in Sweden, whereas herpes zoster vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine for the elderly was not cost-effective-the health effects of the latter vaccination cannot be considered reasonable in relation to its costs. Future observational and surveillance studies are needed to make reasonable predictions on how boosting affects the herpes zoster incidence in the population, and thus the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination programme against varicella. Also, the link between herpes zoster and sequelae need to be studied in more detail to include it suitably in health economic evaluations.", "FAU": ["Wolff, Ellen", "Widgren, Katarina", "Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo", "Roth, Adam", "Lep, Tiia", "Andersson, Soren"], "AU": ["Wolff E", "Widgren K", "Scalia Tomba G", "Roth A", "Lep T", "Andersson S"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2339-0529"], "AD": ["Department of Public Health Analysis and Data Management, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden.", "School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.", "Department of Public Health Analysis and Data Management, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden.", "Department of Medicine, Huddinge C2:94, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.", "Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.", "Institution for Translational Medicine, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.", "Department of Public Health Analysis and Data Management, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden.", "Department of Public Health Analysis and Data Management, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 17:28"], "PHST": ["2020/08/28 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/29 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 17:28 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0251644 [doi]", "PONE-D-20-26903 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2021 May 13;16(5):e0251644. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251644. eCollection 2021."}
