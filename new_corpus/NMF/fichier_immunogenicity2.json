Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors disrupt the engagement of PD-1 on T-cells and their ligands on tumor or other target cells and reactivate the tumor-specific T infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are mostly in a state of anergy before the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. However, a limited number of patients initially respond, and the others show a primary (innate) resistance. Moreover, the rate of relapse and tumor progression after a partial, or even complete response (secondary or acquired resistance) is relatively considerable. AREAS COVERED: This paper presents a comprehensive discussion on the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Loss of T-cell infiltration or T-cell exclusion, lack of PD-L1 or PD-1 expression, and also lack of tumor immunogenicity are among the most important mechanisms, and also biomarkers of resistance in patients undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Several somatic mutations in tumors are known to be related to at least one of the resistance mechanisms. EXPERT OPINION: Identification of the novel resistance mechanisms suggests further combinatorial therapies to tackle primary and secondary resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.", "FAU": ["Pezeshki, Parmida Sadat", "Mahdavi Sharif, Pouya", "Rezaei, Nima"], "AU": ["Pezeshki PS", "Mahdavi Sharif P", "Rezaei N"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2817-4734", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3836-1827"], "AD": ["Cancer Immunology Project (CIP), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran.", "School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "Cancer Immunology Project (CIP), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran.", "School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "Research Center for Immunodeficiencies, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "Cancer Immunology Project (CIP), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Sheffield, UK."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "England", "TA": "Expert Opin Biol Ther", "JT": "Expert opinion on biological therapy", "JID": "101125414", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Anti-PD-1 resistance", "Anti-PD-L1 resistance", "Cancer", "IFN-gamma resistance", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors", "Somatic mutation", "T-cell infiltration", "immunotherapy", "tumor mutation burden"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:08"], "PHST": ["2021/05/13 20:08 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1080/14712598.2021.1929919 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2021 May 13. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2021.1929919."}
