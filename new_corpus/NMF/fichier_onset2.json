To date, normal multisensory processing has hardly been investigated in synaesthetes. In the present study we examine processes of audiovisual separation in synaesthesia by using a simultaneity judgement task. Subjects were asked to indicate whether an acoustic and a visual stimulus occurred simultaneously or not. Stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) as well as the temporal order of the stimuli were systematically varied. Our results demonstrate that synaesthetes are better in separating auditory and visual events than control subjects, but only when vision leads.", "FAU": ["Borgolte, Anna", "Bransi, Ahmad", "Seifert, Johanna", "Toto, Sermin", "Szycik, Gregor R", "Sinke, Christopher"], "AU": ["Borgolte A", "Bransi A", "Seifert J", "Toto S", "Szycik GR", "Sinke C"], "AD": ["Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.", "Oberberg Fachklinik Weserbergland, Brede 29, 32699 Extertal-Lassbruch, Germany.", "Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.", "Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.", "Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.", "Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.", "Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Division of Clinical Psychology & Sexual Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8678-7419", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9339-1191", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1716-6229"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210512", "PL": "Netherlands", "TA": "Multisens Res", "JT": "Multisensory research", "JID": "101604290", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:30"], "PHST": ["2020/12/10 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 20:30 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1163/22134808-bja10050 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Multisens Res. 2021 May 12:1-12. doi: 10.1163/22134808-bja10050."}
