Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation participates in the processes of driving CRC initiation and progression. Aberrant expression of miR-1301 has been found in various tumor types. However, its role in CRC remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we identified miR-1301 was enriched in normal colorectal tissues and significantly down-regulated in CRC. Decreased level of miR-1301 strongly correlated with aggressive pathological characteristics, including advanced stage and metastasis. Bioinformatics and dual luciferase assay demonstrated that STAT3 is a direct target of miR-1301. Gain and loss-of-function assays showed that miR-1301 had no effect on cell proliferation. Overexpression of miR-1301 suppressed cell migration and invasion capacity of pSTAT3-positive LoVo cells, but not pSTAT3-negative SW480 cells, while inhibition of miR-1301 consistently promoted cell migration and invasion in both cell lines. Additionally, miR-1301 inhibition restored the suppressed migration and invasion of STAT3-knockdown LoVo cells. MiR-1301 functioned as a tumor suppressor to modulate the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway. In summary, this study highlights the significant role of miR-1301/STAT3 axis in CRC metastasis.", "CI": ["(c) 2020 Fangfang Yang et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."], "FAU": ["Yang, Fangfang", "Wang, Hua", "Yan, Bianbian", "Li, Tong", "Min, Lulu", "Chen, Erfei", "Yang, Jin"], "AU": ["Yang F", "Wang H", "Yan B", "Li T", "Min L", "Chen E", "Yang J"], "AD": ["Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Institute of Preventive Genomic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China.", "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5394-2366"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Biol Chem", "JT": "Biological chemistry", "JID": "9700112", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["STAT3", "cell migration and invasion", "colorectal cancer", "metastasis", "miRNA regulation"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:32"], "PHST": ["2020/09/04 00:00 [received]", "2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 20:32 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["hsz-2020-0301 [pii]", "10.1515/hsz-2020-0301 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Biol Chem. 2021 May 13. pii: hsz-2020-0301. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2020-0301."}
