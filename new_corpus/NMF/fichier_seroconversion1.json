Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts. METHODS: 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). RESULTS: Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9%) compared to all other assays (>/=98.8%) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8%) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Serial sampling in COVID-19 patients revealed earlier seroconversion and higher signal ratios of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a potential risk marker for the development of ARDS, suggesting a utility for antibody testing in acutely diseased patients.", "FAU": ["Buchholtz, Marie-Luise", "Arend, Florian M", "Eichhorn, Peter", "Weigand, Michael", "Kleinhempel, Alisa", "Hausler, Kurt", "Bruegel, Mathias", "Holdt, Lesca M", "Teupser, Daniel"], "AU": ["Buchholtz ML", "Arend FM", "Eichhorn P", "Weigand M", "Kleinhempel A", "Hausler K", "Bruegel M", "Holdt LM", "Teupser D"], "AD": ["Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.", "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9843-0145"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 17:27"], "PHST": ["2020/10/15 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/28 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 17:27 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0251587 [doi]", "PONE-D-20-32451 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2021 May 13;16(5):e0251587. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251587. eCollection 2021."}
