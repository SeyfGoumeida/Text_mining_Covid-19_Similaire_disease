Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.", "FAU": ["Khan, Muhammad Salim", "Haq, Inaamul", "Qurieshi, Mariya Amin", "Majid, Sabhiya", "Bhat, Arif Akbar", "Qazi, Tanzeela Bashir", "Chowdri, Iqra Nisar", "Sabah, Iram", "Kawoosa, Misbah Ferooz", "Lone, Abdul Aziz", "Nabi, Shahroz", "Sumji, Ishtiyaq Ahmad", "Obaid, Muhammad", "Kousar, Rafiya"], "AU": ["Khan MS", "Haq I", "Qurieshi MA", "Majid S", "Bhat AA", "Qazi TB", "Chowdri IN", "Sabah I", "Kawoosa MF", "Lone AA", "Nabi S", "Sumji IA", "Obaid M", "Kousar R"], "AD": ["Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Biochemistry, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Biochemistry, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Biochemistry, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India.", "Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Kashmir, India."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Hosp Med", "JT": "Journal of hospital medicine", "JID": "101271025", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2021/05/01 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/01 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/04/30 17:29"], "PHST": ["2020/11/25 00:00 [received]", "2021/02/14 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/04/30 17:29 [entrez]", "2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["jhm.3609 [pii]", "10.12788/jhm.3609 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "J Hosp Med. 2021 May;16(5):274-281. doi: 10.12788/jhm.3609."}
