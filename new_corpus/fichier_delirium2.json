OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hospital course for COVID-19 patients with dementia to an aging cohort without dementia in a large New York City academic medical center. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, p = 0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, p < 0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with dementia had higher mortality, but dementia was not an independent risk factor for death. These patients were approximately 3 times more likely to present with delirium but less often manifested or communicated other common COVID-19 symptoms. For this high-risk population in a worsening pandemic, understanding the unique manifestations and course in dementia and aging populations may help guide earlier diagnosis and optimize medical management.", "FAU": ["Harb, Amro A", "Chen, RuiJun", "Chase, Herbert S", "Natarajan, Karthik", "Noble, James M"], "AU": ["Harb AA", "Chen R", "Chase HS", "Natarajan K", "Noble JM"], "AD": ["Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA.", "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.", "Department of Translational Data Science and Informatics, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.", "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.", "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.", "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, GH Sergievsky Center, New York, NY, USA.", "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA.", "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.", "New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210313", "PL": "Netherlands", "TA": "J Alzheimers Dis", "JT": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "JID": "9814863", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Advance directives", "COVID-19", "delirium", "dementia", "geriatrics", "neurology"], "EDAT": "2021/03/23 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/03/23 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/03/22 12:44"], "PHST": ["2021/03/22 12:44 [entrez]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["JAD210050 [pii]", "10.3233/JAD-210050 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Alzheimers Dis. 2021 Mar 13. pii: JAD210050. doi: 10.3233/JAD-210050."}
