Furthermore, they exert different effects on innate and adaptive immune cells. Due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions, these drugs are largely used for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In comparison to other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), to date no reliable evidence is available for the use of systemic GCs in Sjogren's syndrome (SS), which is still based on case reports, case studies, retrospective or prospective studies and a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Despite this gap in our knowledge, GCs are commonly used in SS for glandular, joint, cutaneous, lung, haematological, renal, neurological involvement. More recently, some sets of recommendations for the management of SS have provided a few pieces of advice regarding the use of GCs in this condition. Future studies should not neglect the role of GCs, as this traditional therapeutic weapon can still have a role in the management of SS. Accordingly, this review will address and discuss the use of systemic GCs in isolated or primary SS.", "FAU": ["Priori, Roberta", "Mastromanno, Linda", "Izzo, Raffaella"], "AU": ["Priori R", "Mastromanno L", "Izzo R"], "AD": ["Department of Clinical Internal, Anesthesiological and Cardiovascular Sciences, Rheumatology Unit, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. roberta.priori63@gmail.com.", "Department of Clinical Internal, Anesthesiological and Cardiovascular Sciences, Rheumatology Unit, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.", "Department of Clinical Internal, Anesthesiological and Cardiovascular Sciences, Rheumatology Unit, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20201023", "PL": "Italy", "TA": "Clin Exp Rheumatol", "JT": "Clinical and experimental rheumatology", "JID": "8308521", "RN": ["0 (Glucocorticoids)"], "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "*Autoimmune Diseases", "Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use", "Humans", "*Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "*Sjogren's Syndrome/diagnosis/drug therapy"], "EDAT": "2020/10/24 06:00", "MHDA": "2020/10/28 06:00", "CRDT": ["2020/10/23 12:10"], "PHST": ["2020/03/29 00:00 [received]", "2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]", "2020/10/23 12:10 [entrez]", "2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]", "2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["15562 [pii]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2020 Jul-Aug;38 Suppl 126(4):237-244.
