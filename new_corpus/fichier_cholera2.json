Locally produced, intestinal-mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies against bacterial surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigens and/or secreted cholera toxins are responsible for the protective adaptive immunity, in conjunction with an effective mucosal immunologic memory that can elicit a rapid anamnestic SIgA antibody response upon re-exposure to the antigen/pathogen even many years later. Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs), based on inactivated Vibrio cholerae whole-cell components, either together with the cholera toxin B subunit (Dukoral) or administered alone (Shanchol/Euvichol-Plus) were shown to be consistently safe and effective in large field trials in all settings. These OCVs are recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the control of both endemic cholera and epidemic cholera outbreaks. OCVs are now a cornerstone in WHO's global strategy found in \"Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030.\" However, the forecasted global demands for OCV, estimated by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) to 1.5 billion doses for the period 2020-2029, markedly exceed the existing manufacturing capacity. This calls for an increased production capacity of existing OCVs, as well as the rapid introduction of additional and improved vaccines under development.", "FAU": ["Holmgren, Jan"], "AU": ["Holmgren J"], "AD": ["University of Gothenburg Vaccine Research Institute, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.", "University of Gothenburg Vaccine Research Institute, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210428", "PL": "Switzerland", "TA": "Trop Med Infect Dis", "JT": "Tropical medicine and infectious disease", "JID": "101709042", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["cholera", "cholera control", "mucosal immunity", "oral cholera vaccine"], "EDAT": "2021/05/01 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/01 06:01", "CRDT": ["2021/04/30 01:30"], "PHST": ["2021/03/10 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/16 00:00 [revised]", "2021/04/17 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/04/30 01:30 [entrez]", "2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]"], "AID": ["tropicalmed6020064 [pii]", "10.3390/tropicalmed6020064 [doi]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "Trop Med Infect Dis. 2021 Apr 28;6(2). pii: tropicalmed6020064. doi: 10.3390/tropicalmed6020064."}
