It is a key factor in lifestyle-related diseases including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Owing to its altered serum chemistry status under pathological states, it is now being investigated to unravel the mechanism by which it triggers various health complications. Numerous clinical studies in cancer patients indicate an alteration in blood cholesterol level (either decreased or increased) in comparison to normal healthy individuals. This article elaborates on our understanding as to how cholesterol is being hijacked in the malignancy for the development, survival, stemness, progression, and metastasis of cancerous cells. Also, it provides a glimpse of how cholesterol derived entities, alters the signaling pathway towards their advantage. Moreover, deregulation of the cholesterol metabolism pathway has been often reported to hamper various treatment strategies in different cancer. In this context, attempts have been made to bring forth its relevance in being targeted, in pre-clinical and clinical studies for various treatment modalities. Thus, understanding the role of cholesterol and deciphering associated molecular mechanisms in cancer progression and therapy are of relevance towards improvement in the management of various cancers.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.
