However, the actin cytoskeleton regulators involved and the specific mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse alter their expression or function are largely unknown. Twinfilin (Twf1) is a highly conserved actin-depolymerizing factor that regulates actin dynamics in organisms from yeast to mammals. Despite abundant expression of Twf1 in mammalian brain, little is known about its importance for brain functions such as experience-dependent synaptic and behavioral plasticity. Here we show that conditioned morphine withdrawal (CMW)-induced synaptic structure and behavior plasticity depends on downregulation of Twf1 in the amygdala of rats. Genetically manipulating Twf1 expression in the amygdala bidirectionally regulates CMW-induced changes in actin polymerization, spine density and behavior. We further demonstrate that downregulation of Twf1 is due to upregulation of miR101a expression via a previously unrecognized mechanism involving CMW-induced increases in miR101a nuclear processing via phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421. Our findings establish the importance of Twf1 in regulating opioid-induced synaptic and behavioral plasticity and demonstrate its value as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of opioid addiction.", "FAU": ["Wang, Yu-Jun", "Yu, Chuan", "Wu, Wei-Wei", "Ju, Yun-Yue", "Liu, Yao", "Xu, Chi", "Long, Jian-Dong", "Zan, Gui-Ying", "Wei, Xiang-Yan", "Zhang, Le-Sha", "Chai, Jing-Rui", "Chen, Zhong", "Liu, Jing-Gen"], "AU": ["Wang YJ", "Yu C", "Wu WW", "Ju YY", "Liu Y", "Xu C", "Long JD", "Zan GY", "Wei XY", "Zhang LS", "Chai JR", "Chen Z", "Liu JG"], "AD": ["Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. yjwang@mail.simm.ac.cn.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Department of Neurobiology and Acupuncture Research, The Third Clinical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Neurology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "School of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.", "Department of Neurobiology and Acupuncture Research, The Third Clinical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Neurology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China. chenzhong@zju.edu.cn.", "Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. jgliu@simm.ac.cn.", "Department of Neurobiology and Acupuncture Research, The Third Clinical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Neurology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China. jgliu@simm.ac.cn."], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4755-9357", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2869-0029"], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["81130087/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science", "Foundation of China)", "81671322/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science", "Foundation of China)", "81773710/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science", "Foundation of China)", "2017334/Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "(Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS)"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210507", "PL": "England", "TA": "Mol Psychiatry", "JT": "Molecular psychiatry", "JID": "9607835", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2021/05/09 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/09 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/08 07:00"], "PHST": ["2020/09/09 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/09 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/03/26 00:00 [revised]", "2021/05/08 07:00 [entrez]", "2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/09 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1038/s41380-021-01111-3 [doi]", "10.1038/s41380-021-01111-3 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Mol Psychiatry. 2021 May 7. pii: 10.1038/s41380-021-01111-3. doi: 10.1038/s41380-021-01111-3."}
