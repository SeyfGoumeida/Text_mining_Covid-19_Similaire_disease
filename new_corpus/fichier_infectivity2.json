Late blight in tomato is caused by the oomycota hemibiotroph Phytophthora infestans, and this disease represents a global threat to tomato farming. The pathogen is cumbersome to control because of its fast-evolving nature, ability to overcome host resistance and inefficient natural resistance obtained from the available tomato germplasm. To achieve successful control over this pathogen, the molecular pathogenicity of P. infestans and key points of vulnerability in the host plant immune system must be understood. This review primarily focuses on efforts to better understand the molecular interaction between host pathogens from both perspectives, as well as the resistance genes, metabolomic changes, quantitative trait loci with potential for improvement in disease resistance and host genome manipulation via transgenic approaches, and it further identifies research gaps and provides suggestions for future research priorities.", "FAU": ["Mazumdar, Purabi", "Singh, Pooja", "Kethiravan, Dharane", "Ramathani, Idd", "Ramakrishnan, N"], "AU": ["Mazumdar P", "Singh P", "Kethiravan D", "Ramathani I", "Ramakrishnan N"], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9466-899X"], "AD": ["Centre for Research in Biotechnology for Agriculture, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. purabi@um.edu.my.", "Centre for Research in Biotechnology for Agriculture, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.", "Centre for Research in Biotechnology for Agriculture, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.", "National Crops Resources Research Institute, Gayaza Road Namulonge, 7084, Kampala, Uganda.", "ECSE, School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, 47500, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia."], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["RU004D-2020/Universiti Malaya", "FP005-2020/Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS)"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20210508", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Planta", "JT": "Planta", "JID": "1250576", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Crinkler", "Effector", "Fungus", "Molecular pathogenesis", "Plant immunity", "RXLR"], "EDAT": "2021/05/09 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/09 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/08 12:09"], "PHST": ["2021/01/27 00:00 [received]", "2021/05/01 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/08 12:09 [entrez]", "2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/09 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1007/s00425-021-03636-x [doi]", "10.1007/s00425-021-03636-x [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "Planta. 2021 May 8;253(6):119. doi: 10.1007/s00425-021-03636-x."}
