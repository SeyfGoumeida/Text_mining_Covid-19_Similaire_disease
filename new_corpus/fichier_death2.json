ICIs are generally more tolerable than cytotoxic chemotherapies in terms of toxicity, and ICI-related adverse events are mild and manageable. However, these drugs may lead to unexpected severe adverse events such as immune-related hematologic toxicities, which could be life-threatening. Here, a rare case of a pembrolizumab-related adverse event in a patient with NSCLC who showed early-onset hemolytic anemia and recovered by high-dose steroid and a series of plasma exchanges is reported.", "FAU": ["Baek, Dong Won", "Chae, Yee Soo"], "AU": ["Baek DW", "Chae YS"], "AD": ["Department of Hematology/Oncology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital, Daegu, Korea.", "Department of Hematology/Oncology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital, Daegu, Korea."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Case Reports"], "DEP": "20210323", "PL": "Korea (South)", "TA": "Yeungnam Univ J Med", "JT": "Yeungnam University journal of medicine", "JID": "101590467", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Autoimmune hemolytic anemia", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors", "Non-small-cell lung carcinoma", "Pembrolizumab"], "EDAT": "2021/03/23 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/03/23 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/03/22 21:13"], "PHST": ["2021/01/12 00:00 [received]", "2021/02/23 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/03/22 21:13 [entrez]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["yujm.2021.00899 [pii]", "10.12701/yujm.2021.00899 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Yeungnam Univ J Med. 2021 Mar 23. pii: yujm.2021.00899. doi: 10.12701/yujm.2021.00899."}
