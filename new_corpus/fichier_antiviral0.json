Deficits in synaptic transmission underlie a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, drugs that target AMPARs are challenging to develop, given the central role played in neurotransmission. Targeting AMPAR auxiliary factors offers an innovative approach for achieving specificity without altering baseline synaptic transmission. This review focuses on the SynDIG/proline-rich transmembrane protein (PRRT) family of AMPAR-associated transmembrane proteins. Although these factors are related based on sequence similarity, the proteins have evolved diverse actions at excitatory synapses that are not limited to the traditional role ascribed to an AMPAR auxiliary factor. SynDIG4/PRRT1 acts as a typical AMPAR auxiliary protein, while PRRT2 functions at presynaptic sites to regulate synaptic vesicle dynamics and is the causative gene for neurological paroxysmal disorders in humans. SynDIG/PRRT proteins are members of a larger superfamily that also include antiviral proteins known to restrict fusion between host and viral membranes and share some interesting characteristics.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 The Author.
