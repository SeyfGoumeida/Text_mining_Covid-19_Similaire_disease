In the U.S., more than one third of fruit-related outbreaks have been linked to two S. enterica serotypes Newport and Typhimurium. Approximately 80% of fruit-related human salmonellosis cases were associated with tomatoes, cantaloupes and cucumbers. In this study, we investigated the population dynamics of S. Newport and S. Typhimurium on fresh-cut tomato, cantaloupe, cucumber and apple under short-term storage conditions. We further compared the transcriptomic profiles of a S. Newport strain on fresh-cut tomato and cantaloupe using high-throughput RNA-seq. We demonstrated that both S. enterica Newport and Typhimurium survived well on various fresh-cut fruit items under refrigeration storage conditions, independent of inoculation levels. However, S. enterica displayed variable survival behaviors on different types of fruits. For example, at 7 d storage, the population of S. enterica reduced less than 0.2 log (p > 0.05) on fresh-cut tomato and cantaloupe, in contrast to ~0.5 log (p < 0.05) on cucumber and apple. RNA-seq analysis suggested that S. enterica mediates its survival on fresh-cut fruits through differentially regulating genes involved in specific carbon utilization and metabolic pathways. Several known bacterial virulence factors (e.g., pag gene) were found to be differentially regulated on fresh-cut tomato and cantaloupe, suggesting a link between the events of food contamination and subsequent human infection. Findings from this study contribute to a better understanding of S. enterica survival mechanisms on fresh-cut produce.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
