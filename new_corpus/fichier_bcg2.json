This vaccine has been shown to provide some degree of non-specific protection from other respiratory tract infections. This advantage has encouraged researchers to investigate the potential protection of this vaccine from the coronavirus disease 2019 from different perspectives in the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we have comprehensively reviewed the latest articles on potential vaccine effectiveness of BCG on COVID-19 and summarized the possible impacts of the BCG against SARS-COV-2 in detail.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part", "of Springer Nature 2021."], "FAU": ["Bagheri, Narges", "Montazeri, Hesam"], "AU": ["Bagheri N", "Montazeri H"], "AD": ["Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Azarbaijan Shahid Madani, Tabriz, Iran.grid.411468.e0000 0004 0417 5692", "Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB), University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.grid.46072.370000 0004 0612 7950", "Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB), University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.grid.46072.370000 0004 0612 7950"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20210315", "PL": "Switzerland", "TA": "SN Compr Clin Med", "JT": "SN comprehensive clinical medicine", "JID": "101740833", "PMC": "PMC7956872", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["BCG vaccine", "COVID-19", "Non-specific vaccine protection", "Tuberculosis"], "COIS": ["Competing InterestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests."], "EDAT": "2021/03/23 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/03/23 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/03/22 08:28"], "PHST": ["2021/02/21 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/03/22 08:28 [entrez]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1007/s42399-021-00835-1 [doi]", "835 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "SN Compr Clin Med. 2021 Mar 15:1-11. doi: 10.1007/s42399-021-00835-1."}
