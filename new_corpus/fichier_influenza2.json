F) Wall ex Nees: Antiviral properties.", "LID": "10.1002/ptr.7145 [doi]", "AB": "Andrographis paniculata is home to a rich variety of molecules especially andrographolide and its derivatives. Clinical properties of the andrographolide are multifarious and include: analgesic, antipyretic, antiretroviral, antiproliferative, antimalarial, antithrombotic, antihyperglycemic, antiurolethial, antilesihmaniasis, hepatoprotective, immune-modulatory, protective against alcohol induced toxicity and cardioproetcive activity and anticancer activity. Andrographolide, neoandrographolide, dehydroandrographolide and several natural and synthetic derivatives of it: 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide and 14-deoxyandrographolide, dehydroandrographolide succinic acid monoester (DAMS), 14-alpha-lipoyl andrographolide (AL-1), 14-acetyl-3,9-isopropyl-ideneandrographolide, 14-acetylandrographolide, 3,14,19-triacetylandrographolide, and 3,9-isopropyl-idene andrographolide, are shown to possess significant antiviral activity against HIV, influenza A, HBV, HCV, HPP and HSV. Studies on SARS CoV 2 is restricted to in silico molecular docking studies on viral targets and selected host target proteins. The main targets of andrographolide and its derivatives are fusion and adsorption of virus to the host cell, binding to viral receptor and co-receptor, enzymes involved in DNA/RNA/Genome replication by the virus, translation, post-translation and reverse transcription. Andrographolide as a drug is yet to reach its full therapeutic potential since this molecule shows low bioavailability. Andrographolide therapy is in need of an appropriate delivery system that may increase its bioavailability. Further high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the plant.", "CI": ["(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."], "FAU": ["Jadhav, Ashwini Khanderao", "Karuppayil, Sankunny Mohan"], "AU": ["Jadhav AK", "Karuppayil SM"], "AD": ["Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Centre For Interdisciplinary Research, DY Patil Education Society (Deemed to be University) Kolhapur, Kasaba Bawada, Maharashtra, 416006, India.", "Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Centre For Interdisciplinary Research, DY Patil Education Society (Deemed to be University) Kolhapur, Kasaba Bawada, Maharashtra, 416006, India."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5583-0381"], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["Ref.
