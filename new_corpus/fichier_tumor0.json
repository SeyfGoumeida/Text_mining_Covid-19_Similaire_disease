METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with stage IB-II cervical cancer who underwent type III radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy between 2008 and 2017. In our institution, radical hysterectomy is performed as an open surgery and not as a minimally invasive surgery, and adjuvant therapy is not administered to patients with intermediate-risk cervical cancer. The intermediate-risk group included patients with 2 or more of the following factors: tumor size >4 cm, stromal invasion >1/2, and lymphovascular stromal invasion. Intermediaterisk patients with squamous cell carcinoma were included in the I-SCC group, whereas those with endocervical adenocarcinoma, usual type, or adenosquamous carcinoma were included in the I-Adeno group. RESULTS: There were 34 and 18 patients in the I-SCC and I-Adeno groups, respectively. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival rates in the I-SCC group were 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3-95.7%) and 100% (95% CI, 100%), respectively, whereas those in the I-Adeno group were 54.9% (95% CI, 42.0-67.9%) and 76.1% (95% CI, 63.7-88.4%), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that endocervical adenocarcinoma, usual type, or adenosquamous carcinoma, and tumor size >4 cm had worse RFS. CONCLUSION: The I-SCC group had good prognosis without adjuvant therapy; therefore, adjuvant therapy may be omitted in these patients. In contrast, the I-Adeno group had poor prognosis without adjuvant therapy; therefore, adjuvant therapy should be considered in their treatment.", "FAU": ["Yoneoka, Yutaka", "Kato, Mayumi Kobayashi", "Tanase, Yasuhito", "Uno, Masaya", "Ishikawa, Mitsuya", "Murakami, Takashi", "Kato, Tomoyasu"], "AU": ["Yoneoka Y", "Kato MK", "Tanase Y", "Uno M", "Ishikawa M", "Murakami T", "Kato T"], "AD": ["Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.", "Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.", "Department of Gynecology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210108", "PL": "Korea (South)", "TA": "Obstet Gynecol Sci", "JT": "Obstetrics & gynecology science", "JID": "101602614", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Carcinoma", "Recurrence", "Squamous cells", "Uterine cervical neoplasms"], "EDAT": "2021/03/23 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/03/23 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/03/22 21:57"], "PHST": ["2020/08/18 00:00 [received]", "2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/03/22 21:57 [entrez]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["ogs.20243 [pii]", "10.5468/ogs.20243 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Obstet Gynecol Sci. 2021 Mar;64(2):226-233. doi: 10.5468/ogs.20243.
