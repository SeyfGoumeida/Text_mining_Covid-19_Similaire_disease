The aim was to assess the association between physical activity and self-reported CR fitness on COVID-19 infection characteristics. METHODS: Participants formerly testing positive for COVID-19 completed an online questionnaire measuring COVID-19 infection characteristics and complications, self-reported CR fitness level, physical activity, and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Self-reported CR fitness was determined as the pace to cover 4.8 km without becoming overly fatigued (with slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, and running corresponding to low, moderate, good, and excellent levels of fitness, respectively). RESULTS: A total of 263 individuals completed the survey. Compared with the lowest level of self-reported CR fitness, the odds of hospitalization significantly decreased by 64% (odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.98; P = .04) in individuals reporting the ability to maintain a brisk walk. In individuals reporting the ability to maintain a jogging pace, the further reduction in hospitalization was not significant (odds ratio = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.04; P = .05). For COVID-19 symptom severity and number, there were no significant associations with self-reported CR fitness or physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with low self-reported CR fitness, improving CR fitness represents a strategy to reduce the risk of hospitalization from COVID-19.", "FAU": ["Brandenburg, Jason P", "Lesser, Iris A", "Thomson, Cynthia J", "Giles, Luisa V"], "AU": ["Brandenburg JP", "Lesser IA", "Thomson CJ", "Giles LV"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210512", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Phys Act Health", "JT": "Journal of physical activity & health", "JID": "101189457", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["coronavirus", "exercise", "physical activity", "physical fitness"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 20:30"], "PHST": ["2020/12/02 00:00 [received]", "2021/03/14 00:00 [revised]", "2021/03/14 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 20:30 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1123/jpah.2020-0817 [doi]", "jpah.2020-0817 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Phys Act Health. 2021 May 12:1-7. doi: 10.1123/jpah.2020-0817."}
