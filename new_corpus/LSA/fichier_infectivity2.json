A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection.", "FAU": ["Miotto, Mattia", "Di Rienzo, Lorenzo", "Gosti, Giorgio", "Milanetti, Edoardo", "Ruocco, Giancarlo"], "AU": ["Miotto M", "Di Rienzo L", "Gosti G", "Milanetti E", "Ruocco G"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0043-8921"], "AD": ["Department of Physics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.", "Center for Life Nano & Neuroscience, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.", "Center for Life Nano & Neuroscience, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.", "Center for Life Nano & Neuroscience, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Physics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.", "Center for Life Nano & Neuroscience, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Physics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.", "Center for Life Nano & Neuroscience, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 17:27"], "PHST": ["2020/11/17 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/18 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 17:27 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0251535 [doi]", "PONE-D-20-36160 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2021 May 13;16(5):e0251535. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251535. eCollection 2021."}
