Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection. Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts.", "FAU": ["Thompson, Corinne N", "Hughes, Scott", "Ngai, Stephanie", "Baumgartner, Jennifer", "Wang, Jade C", "McGibbon, Emily", "Devinney, Katelynn", "Luoma, Elizabeth", "Bertolino, Daniel", "Hwang, Christina", "Kepler, Kelsey", "Del Castillo, Cybill", "Hopkins, Melissa", "Lee, Henry", "DeVito, Andrea K", "Rakeman, Jennifer L", "Fine, Anne D"], "AU": ["Thompson CN", "Hughes S", "Ngai S", "Baumgartner J", "Wang JC", "McGibbon E", "Devinney K", "Luoma E", "Bertolino D", "Hwang C", "Kepler K", "Del Castillo C", "Hopkins M", "Lee H", "DeVito AK", "Rakeman JL", "Fine AD"], "CN": ["PhD1"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210514", "PL": "United States", "TA": "MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep", "JT": "MMWR.
