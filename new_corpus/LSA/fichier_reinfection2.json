His generator was removed with partial resection of the epicardial leads, and a new device was reimplanted in his left prepectoral area. The abdominal wound was left open, and debridement was performed for several times. After the wound was cured, he complicated a chest pain and was diagnosed with residural epicardial pacemaker lead infection. He underwent complete removal of infected epicardial pacemaker leads and omentopexy under extracorporeal circulation via resternotomy. Postoperative course was uneventful. There was no sign of reinfection during the two-year follow-up.", "FAU": ["Okada, Shuichi", "Hoshino, Joji", "Ezure, Masahiko", "Hasegawa, Yutaka", "Yamada, Yasuyuki", "Morishita, Hiroyuki", "Kanazawa, Yuta", "Kaga, Tohru"], "AU": ["Okada S", "Hoshino J", "Ezure M", "Hasegawa Y", "Yamada Y", "Morishita H", "Kanazawa Y", "Kaga T"], "AD": ["Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Gunma Prefectural Cardiovascular Center, Maebashi, Japan."], "LA": ["jpn"], "PT": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "PL": "Japan", "TA": "Kyobu Geka", "JT": "Kyobu geka.
