Pigs were administered the vaccine intramuscularly as either at 3 and 24 days of age with 1.0mL or at 21 days of age with 2.0mL according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The pigs were challenged at 42 days of age with either PCV2d (intranasal route) or M. hyopneumoniae (intratracheal route), or both. No statistical differences were observed between the one-dose and two-dose experiments based on clinical (growth performance), immunological (protective immunity), microbiological (viremia and laryngeal swab), and pathological (pulmonary and lymphoid lesion) outcomes. Pigs in vaccinated/challenged and unvaccinated/unchallenged groups showed significant difference in growth performance compared to pigs in the unvaccinated/challenged group in both dosage experiments. Vaccinated pigs elicited a significant amount of protective immunity for PCV2d-specific neutralizing antibodies and interferon-gamma secreting cells (IFN-gamma-SC) as well as M. hyopneumoniae-specific IFN-gamma-SC significantly post-challenge compared to unvaccinated/challenged pigs. Vaccination and challenge reduced the viral load amount of PCV2d in the blood and reduced the M. hyopneumoniae load in laryngeal swab, while simultaneously reducing both pulmonary and lymphoid lesion severity when compared to unvaccinated/challenged pigs. Trivalent vaccination provided good protection against a single PCV2d challenge, single M. hyopneumoniae challenge, and a PCV2d/M. hyopneumoniae dual challenge.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
