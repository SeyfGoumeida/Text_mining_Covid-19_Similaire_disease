Here, we investigated the risk factors associated with CDV exposure in domestic and wild carnivores from the Janos Biosphere Reserve (JBR), Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was performed in four rural towns to investigate the risk factors associated with the presence of CDV in domestic and wild carnivores from the JBR, Mexico. In addition, we tested serum samples from 70 dogs and three wild carnivores, including one bobcat (Lynx rufus), one striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and one gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) for CDV antibodies using immunochromatographic and viral neutralization assays. Results: Overall, 62% of domestic dogs were seropositive for CDV, and the presence of antibodies was significantly higher in free-roaming owned dogs than dogs with restricted movement. Among the wild carnivores, only the bobcat was seropositive. The rate of vaccination against CDV in dogs was low (7%), and there was a high rate of direct interactions between domestic dogs and wild carnivores. Conclusion: Our serological assays show that CDV is circulating in both domestic dogs and wild carnivores, suggesting cross-species transmission. Our finding of low vaccination rates, high number of unrestrained owned dogs and direct interactions between wildlife and domestic animals reported in the region may be perpetuating the high prevalence of the virus and increasing the risk of CDV transmission between wild and domestic carnivores. Therefore, long-term longitudinal studies are recommended in order to monitor infectious diseases at the domestic-wildlife interface in this highly biodiverse region.", "CI": ["(c) 2021 The Authors.
