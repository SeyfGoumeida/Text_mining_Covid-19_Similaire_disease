OBJECTIVE: We explored the association of CMV-IgG titer of recipients with CMV reactivation after allo-HCT and aimed to establish a model for predicting CMV reactivation for the purpose of identifying a high-risk group. In addition, we evaluated the impact of CMV-IgG titer on survival outcomes and acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed 309 patients who achieved neutrophil engraftment after allo-HCT, and evaluated whether pre-transplant recipient CMV-IgG titer was associated with transplant outcomes including CMV reactivation. Using the best cut-off value determined by a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, we divided cohorts into three groups, \"High-titer\", \"Low-titer\" and \"Negative\" groups. RESULTS: CMV reactivation frequently occurred in the \"High-titer\" group, followed by the \"Low-titer\" and \"Negative-titer\" groups [81%, 37% vs. 16% at 180 days after allo-HCT, P<0.01]. In a multivariate analysis, recipient CMV-IgG titer was significantly associated with subsequent CMV reactivation [HR 9.31 in the \"High-titer\" group, P<0.01; HR 2.91 in the \"Low-titer\" group, P=0.023]. CMV diseases were exclusively observed in the \"High-titer\" group. Overall survival (OS) in the \"High-titer\" group tended to be lower than those in the other two groups [2-year OS 56%, 60% vs. 80%, P=0.075], while the cumulative incidences of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were not significantly different among the three groups. In multivariate analyses, CMV-IgG titer was not associated with increased risks of these outcomes, although CMV reactivation itself was identified as a risk factor of NRM [HR 3.05, P=0.002]. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that a higher titer of recipient CMV-IgG would predict CMV reactivation after allo-HCT. Further investigation will be required to determine how to apply these results to prophylactic or preemptive strategies against CMV, considering recipient CMV-IgG titer for effective risk stratification.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
