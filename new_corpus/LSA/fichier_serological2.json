Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is an underdiagnosed risk factor for CVD, which is prevalent among people with 2DM and can lead to CVD and CVD-related mortality. Little is known about the risk factors associated with CAN in type 2DM. Thus, the study was aimed to assess CAN using five cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (represented by Ewing's score) and explore the factors associated with CAN in people with type 2DM. The studied factors include traditional and serological CVD risk factors obtained from a fasting blood sample and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) obtained via attainment of the highest peak of volumes of O2 (VO2Peak). RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Ewing's score (r=0.47, p=.02) and an inverse correlation between VO2Peak and Ewing's score (r=-0.64, p=.001). Multivariate linear regression revealed that a significant model that included resting SBP and VO2Peak explained 93.8% of Ewing's score variance. CONCLUSION: CAN was associated with two CVD parameters, including resting SBP and CRF, which may indicate the importance of controlling these two factors to prevent or reduce CAN in people with type 2DM.", "FAU": ["Osailan, Ahmad"], "AU": ["Osailan A"], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0124-4739"], "AD": ["Department of Physical Therapy and Health Rehabilitation, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia. ahmad.osailan@gmail.com."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210513", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Egypt Heart J", "JT": "The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology", "JID": "9106952", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Autonomic nervous system", "Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy", "Cardiovascular risk factors", "Diabetes mellitus", "Exercise tolerance test"], "EDAT": "2021/05/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/05/13 12:38"], "PHST": ["2021/02/20 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/30 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/05/13 12:38 [entrez]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1186/s43044-021-00168-3 [doi]", "10.1186/s43044-021-00168-3 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "Egypt Heart J. 2021 May 13;73(1):44. doi: 10.1186/s43044-021-00168-3."}
