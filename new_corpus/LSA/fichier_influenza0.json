Similarly for the influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, there is limited data on the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 prevention for this susceptible patient population. Moreover, preliminary data from vaccinated organ transplanted, inflammatory bowel and connective tissue disease patients suggests only limited immunogenicity after the first vaccine dose, particularly in patients on immunosuppressive regimens. Herein a set of recommendations for the vaccination of immune suppressed patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is proposed aimed at achieving optimal vaccine benefit without interfering with disease activity status. Moreover, rare autoimmune adverse events related to vaccinations are discussed.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
