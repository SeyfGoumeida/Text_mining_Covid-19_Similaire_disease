Although acute cancer-related pain was excluded from these recommendations, studies demonstrate reduced opioid prescribing for patients hospitalized with advanced cancer. OBJECTIVES: We performed a matched case-control analysis to determine how a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) affects inpatient management of cancer pain. METHODS: Charts of patients with OUD admitted for cancer pain from 2015-2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Hospitalizations were matched 1:1 by patient age and sex. Home milligram-morphine equivalent per day (MME/day) was calculated from the home medication list. Admission MME/day was the average MME/day administered during hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 80 hospitalizations (40:40) were matched for 25 patients with a history of OUD and 31 patients with no history of OUD. Cancer was metastatic/relapsed for 70% of admissions. The median overall survival was 2.3 months (95% CI 0-5.21, p=0.13). Patients with OUD had a significantly lower change from Home to Admission MME/day (-3 vs. 37, p < 0.01) and were less likely to have any increase in Admission MME/day (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.43, p <0.01). When considering opioids administered after pain specialty consultation, there was no difference between groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with OUD receive lower quality inpatient management of cancer-related pain. Provider education and early involvement of pain specialists are crucial in delivering equitable and compassionate end-of-life care for patients with OUD.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
