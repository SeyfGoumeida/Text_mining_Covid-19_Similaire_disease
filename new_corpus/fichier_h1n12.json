However, research aiming to examine public willingness to wear (WTW) face masks in Pakistan are scarce. The current research aims to overcome this research void and contributes by expanding the theoretical mechanism of theory of planned behavior (TPB) to include three novel dimensions (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of face masks, and unavailability of face masks) to comprehensively analyze the factors that motivate people to, or inhibit people from, wearing face masks. The study is based on an inclusive questionnaire survey of a sample of 738 respondents in the provincial capitals of Pakistan, namely, Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, Gilgit, and Quetta. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the proposed hypotheses. The results show that attitude, social norms, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of face masks are the major influencing factors that positively affect public WTW face masks, whereas the cost of face masks and unavailability of face masks tend to have opposite effects. The results emphasize the need to enhance risk perceptions by publicizing the deadly effects of COVID-19 on the environment and society, ensure the availability of face masks at an affordable price, and make integrated and coherent efforts to highlight the benefits that face masks offer.", "FAU": ["Irfan, Muhammad", "Akhtar, Nadeem", "Ahmad, Munir", "Shahzad, Farrukh", "Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai", "Wu, Haitao", "Yang, Chuxiao"], "AU": ["Irfan M", "Akhtar N", "Ahmad M", "Shahzad F", "Elavarasan RM", "Wu H", "Yang C"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0003-1446-583X", "ORCID: 0000-0002-8283-4353", "ORCID: 0000-0002-4376-8410", "ORCID: 0000-0002-1095-7207", "ORCID: 0000-0002-7744-6102"], "AD": ["School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.", "Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.", "School of Urban Culture, South China Normal University, Nanhai Campus, Foshan 528225, China.", "Pakistan Center, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750001, China.", "School of Economics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.", "School of Economics and Management, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming 525000, China.", "Clean and Resilient Energy Systems (CARES) Laboratory, Texas A&M University, Galveston, TX 77553, USA.", "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.", "Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.", "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.", "Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China."], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["PKST2020/North Minzu University Annual Research Project"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210426", "PL": "Switzerland", "TA": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "JT": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "JID": "101238455", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "face masks", "risk perceptions", "theory of planned behavior", "willingness to wear"], "EDAT": "2021/05/01 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/05/01 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/04/30 01:33"], "PHST": ["2021/03/09 00:00 [received]", "2021/04/08 00:00 [revised]", "2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/04/30 01:33 [entrez]", "2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["ijerph18094577 [pii]", "10.3390/ijerph18094577 [doi]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Apr 26;18(9). pii: ijerph18094577. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18094577."}
