The status of the infection in the female genital system is still unknown. The study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 infection in reproductive period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women who were between the ages of 18-50 years and clinically confirmed to have COVID-19 infection at our hospital between 20 April-31 May 2020 were included in the study. Women who were in their menstrual cycle during the study and who had a known cervical intraepithelial lesion and/or cancer, sexually transmitted disease and history and/or symptoms of vaginitis were excluded from the study. In patients in whom no pathology was detected during the examination, a sample was taken from the vaginal fluid for PCR by using Dacron tip swab. Analysis was performed with Genesig Real-Time PCR COVID-19 kit (Primer Design, England). RESULTS: Eighteen women who were in reproductive period and diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 38.16 +/- 8.54. None of the patients were in their menopause period. The clinical symptoms of these women were similar to those of confirmed severe COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be negative in the samples taken from the vaginal fluid in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was not detected in the vaginal fluid of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in reproductive period.", "FAU": ["Uslu Yuvaci, Hilal", "Aslan, Mehmet Musa", "Kose, Osman", "Akdemir, Nermin", "Toptan, Hande", "Cevrioglu, Arif Serhan", "Altindis, Mustafa", "Koroglu, Mehmet"], "AU": ["Uslu Yuvaci H", "Aslan MM", "Kose O", "Akdemir N", "Toptan H", "Cevrioglu AS", "Altindis M", "Koroglu M"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0001-8067-3165", "ORCID: 0000-0002-7830-5002", "ORCID: 0000-0001-5656-6853", "ORCID: 0000-0002-9129-2103", "ORCID: 0000-0001-6893-8490", "ORCID: 0000-0002-3810-6519", "ORCID: 0000-0003-0411-9669", "ORCID: 0000-0001-8101-1104"], "AD": ["Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey. jinopdrmma@gmail.com.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Microbiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Microbiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey.", "Department of Microbiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20210310", "PL": "Poland", "TA": "Ginekol Pol", "JT": "Ginekologia polska", "JID": "0374641", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["SARS-CoV-2", "coronavirus", "vaginal fluid"], "EDAT": "2021/03/23 06:00", "MHDA": "2021/03/23 06:00", "CRDT": ["2021/03/22 19:18"], "PHST": ["2020/11/13 00:00 [received]", "2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]", "2021/03/22 19:18 [entrez]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]", "2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["VM/OJS/J/71737 [pii]", "10.5603/GP.a2021.0018 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Ginekol Pol. 2021 Mar 10. pii: VM/OJS/J/71737. doi: 10.5603/GP.a2021.0018."}
