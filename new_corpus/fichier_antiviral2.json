Matrine displayed multiple beneficial effects such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial, but studies of its influence on gut microbiota are still insufficient to report. Here, the present study was conducted to investigate the influence of matrine on the gut microbiota of mice and amoxicillin was used as a positive control. A total of 21 cecal samples were obtained from seven groups for high-throughput sequencing analysis based on V3-V4 variable region of 16S rRNA genes. Results revealed that the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota in mice gradually decreased with the increase of the concentration of amoxicillin, whereas matrine administration did not effect the intestinal microbial community structure. Additionally, amoxicillin and matrine supplementation also caused significant changes in the relative abundance of some intestinal bacteria. Specifically, the ratio of Klebsiella and Corynebacterium_1, Bacteroides and Parasutterella in the amoxicillin treated-group were increased as compared to the control group, whereas Muribaculaceae_unclassified, Alistipes and Lactobacillus were significantly decreased. Conversely, matrine administration significantly increased the proportion of beneficial bacteria such as Ruminiclostridium_9, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Ruminococcaceae_unclassified. In conclusion, amoxicillin administration could change the microbial community composition and structure by increasing the proportion of pathogenic to beneficial bacteria, whereas matrine could increase the number of beneficial bacteria. Moreover, this study provides a theoretical basis for finding alternatives to antibiotics to decrease bacterial resistance and intestinal flora imbalance.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021.
