One strategy to control tuberculosis involves taking advantage of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin's (BCG) superior effects on childhood tuberculosis. Accordingly, here we aimed to develop a booster vaccine for adults who received the BCG vaccine during early childhood. Therefore, we first devised a system to assess the efficacy of a candidate booster vaccine. Specifically, variant strain BCG-II, a minor component of BCG-Tokyo strain, which elicits weak immunity, was administered to guinea pigs. Vaccine-induced immunity and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection were evaluated using skin delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and Mtb colony forming unit counts in organs, respectively. Candidate booster vaccine containing the mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDP1) as antigen and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide G9.1 as adjuvant increased T-bet expression and IFN-gamma production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Intradermal administration of MDP1 or MDP1 and G9.1 to unimmunized guinea pigs produced DTH on MDP1-inoculated skin. Boosting BCG-II-primed guinea pigs with this protocol effectively enhanced DTH against MDP1 and protection against Mtb infection, particularly when combined with G9.1. The candidate vaccine may contribute to efforts to prevent tuberculosis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
